This is a tear modifier for Isaac.
When Isaac shoots, he has a chance of shooting a green tear.
When the tear lands, it explodes into a poisonous gas cloud that deals damage over time when enemies walk into it.
This also raises Isaac's tears by 0.3 and makes them spectral(passes through walls).
This item has several synergies, such as with Technology and Flat Stone.
