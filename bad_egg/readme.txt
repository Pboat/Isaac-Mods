This is an active item for Isaac that rerolls pedestal items to the "glitch" items that the TMTRAINER item spawns. 
When used, the room will change to look like the IAMERROR room. Additionally, the item's charge and sprite will change.
The item should always start with a charge of 6, but can change to 2, 3, 6, or 12.
If the item has a charge of 12, using the item will also spawn a permanent "???" character familiar.
When used with the Book of Virtues, the wisp from the "Undefined" item spawns.
